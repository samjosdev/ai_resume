1.  **Create Users & Players (Admin Tab):**
    *   Go to the **Admin: Users & Players** tab.
    *   Create two users: one with the display name `Alice` and another named `Bob`.
    *   In the "Create Player" section, create at least two players (e.g., `Virat K.`, a Batsman, price 11.0; and `Jasprit B.`, a Bowler, price 10.5).
    *   Confirm the new users and players appear in the tables on the right.

2.  **Create a Match (Admin Tab):**
    *   Go to the **Admin: Matches & Stats** tab.

    *   Navigate to the **Squad** sub-tab. Select `Virat K.` from the "Select Player to Add" dropdown and click "Add to Squad."
    *   **Verify:** Confirm that `Virat K.` now appears in the "Current Squad" table and that Alice's bank balance has decreased accordingly (to 89.0).

4.  **Create and Join a League (League Tab):**
    *   Go to the **League Management** tab.
    *   Under "Create a New League," enter a name (e.g., `Global Championship`), select `Bob` as the creator, and click "Create League."
