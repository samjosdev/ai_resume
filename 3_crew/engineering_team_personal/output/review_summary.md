# **Project Review Summary: Fantasy Cricket Web Application**

| **Project:** | Fantasy Cricket Web Application | **Date:** | October 26, 2023 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Review Focus:** | Foundational Backend & Data Architecture | **Status:** | **Phase 1 Complete** |

### **1. Executive Summary**

This document summarizes the completion of the foundational backend architecture and data model for the Fantasy Cricket Web Application. The core engine that will power all application features is now in place, directly translating the business requirements into a robust and scalable technical solution. This work establishes the database structure, business rule validation, and API framework necessary for building the user-facing application, including user registration, team creation, and league management.

### **2. Key Accomplishments & Progress**

The engineering team has successfully designed and implemented the core backend systems. This milestone represents the "plumbing" of the entire platform.

*   **Complete Database Schema:** A comprehensive and normalized database structure has been finalized and implemented, capable of storing all required data for users, players, matches, teams, leagues, and scoring statistics.
*   **Core User Management:** Backend services for user registration, secure login (using JWT), and profile data management are complete. The foundation for a social "friends" system is also in place.
*   **Team Creation & Validation Engine:** The API now supports the creation of a fantasy team. Crucially, it enforces all business rules outlined in the requirements, including the **$100M budget cap**, player role composition (e.g., min/max batsmen), and squad size.
*   **League Management Framework:** Backend logic is complete for creating both public and private leagues. The system successfully generates unique invite codes for private leagues and manages team memberships.
*   **Scalable Scoring & Real-Time Architecture:** A robust system using a job queue (`BullMQ`) and a high-speed in-memory store (`Redis`) has been designed. This ensures that point calculations will not slow down the main application and that leaderboards can be updated in near real-time, meeting performance requirements.

### **3. Key Technical Decisions**

The following architectural decisions were made to balance speed of delivery with long-term performance and scalability.

| Decision | Technology/Approach | Business Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System Architecture** | **Modular Monolith** | Allows for **faster initial development and deployment** compared to microservices, while being designed in distinct modules (Users, Leagues, etc.) that can be separated later to support future growth. |
| **Technology Stack** | **Node.js/NestJS & React** | A modern, high-performance stack ideal for real-time features like live scoring. Using TypeScript ensures code quality and maintainability. |
| **Data Storage** | **PostgreSQL & Redis** | A dual-database approach provides the best of both worlds: **PostgreSQL** for reliable, structured data (users, teams) and **Redis** for lightning-fast delivery of dynamic data like leaderboards and cached content. |

### **4. Demo & Review Instructions: Verifying Core Logic via API**

The following steps outline how to test the core logic of the completed backend work using an API client (like Postman or Insomnia). This demonstrates that the fundamental business rules and data relationships are working correctly.

**Prerequisite:** The database is pre-populated with mock player data, including their roles and prices. The API is available at `http://api.fantasy-cricket.dev`.

#### **Step 1: Register a New User**

*   **Action:** Send a `POST` request to `/api/auth/register`.
*   **Body (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
      "displayName": "Test_Reviewer",
      "email": "reviewer@fantasy.com",
      "password": "Password123"
    }
    ```
*   **Expected Outcome:** A `201 Created` response containing an authentication token (JWT). This confirms the user account was created successfully.

#### **Step 2: Create a Valid Fantasy Team**

*   **Action:** Send a `POST` request to `/api/teams`, including the authentication token from Step 1.
*   **Body (JSON):** Provide an array of 15 valid `player_id`s that adhere to the budget and composition rules.
    ```json
    {
      "teamName": "Reviewer's Champions",
      "playerIds": ["player_uuid_1", "player_uuid_2", ..., "player_uuid_15"]
    }
    ```
*   **Expected Outcome:** A `201 Created` response. This verifies that the backend successfully validated the team against all business rules (budget, roles, etc.) and linked it to the user. An invalid team (e.g., over budget) would return an error.

#### **Step 3: Create a Private League**

*   **Action:** Send a `POST` request to `/api/leagues` with the auth token.
*   **Body (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Project Reviewers League",
      "type": "Private",
      "startGameweek": 1
    }
    ```
*   **Expected Outcome:** A `201 Created` response containing the league details, including a unique `invite_code`.

#### **Step 4: Join the Private League**

*   **Action:** Send a `POST` request to `/api/leagues/join-private` with the auth token.
*   **Body (JSON):** Use the `invite_code` from the previous step.
    ```json
    {
      "inviteCode": "UNIQUE_CODE_FROM_STEP_3"
    }
    ```
*   **Expected Outcome:** A `200 OK` response. This confirms the user's team has successfully joined the private league, validating the membership logic.

### **5. Next Steps**

With the backend foundation secure, the team will now proceed with the following implementation sprints:
1.  **UI/UX Development:** Building the React/Next.js frontend for User Registration and Team Creation.
2.  **Scoring Engine Implementation:** Activating the background worker to calculate points based on admin-submitted match stats.
3.  **Real-time Leaderboard UI:** Connecting the frontend to the backend via WebSockets to display live-updating leaderboards.
